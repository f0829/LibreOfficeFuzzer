LibreOfficeFuzzer
=================

This repository contais a simple fuzzer (random testing) for LibreOffice, with some docx files. Based on Charlie Miller code from Babysitting an Army of Monkeys.

The idea for this code came from Udacity Course - Software Testing (How to make a software fail!)

Folders:
 -> Files: Contains all public files that are going to be used for testing the app
 -> logs: If something crashes, it generates a log at this folder
